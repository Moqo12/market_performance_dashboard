# Market Performance Dashboard (in USD)

This project is an interactive web-based dashboard built with Python and Streamlit to analyze the performance of US investment factors and sectors, alongside global regions, using US-listed ETFs.

## Core Features

The dashboard is organized into four main tabs, each providing a unique analytical view:

### 1. Factor Performance

- Tracks the performance of key US investment factors (Momentum, Value, Quality, Growth,Low Vol, Size) against the US Market as a primary benchmark.
